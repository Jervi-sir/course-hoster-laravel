### Phase 3: Content Hosting & Player

**Goal:** High-quality delivery and final polish.

* [ ] **Video Storage Setup:**
* Configure Laravel `filesystems.php` for S3 or a similar provider.
* Create a secure link generator (Signed URLs) so videos aren't public.

* [ ] **The "Course Player" Layout:**
* Build a sidebar navigation that lists all modules/lessons.
* Build the main content area with a video player (use `video.js` or `react-player`).


* [ ] **Lesson Content Rendering:**
* If using Markdown, install `parsedown` (PHP) or `react-markdown`.
* Ensure Shadcn `Typography` styles are applied to the rendered content.


* [ ] **File Attachments:**
* Add functionality for students to download PDF/Resource files attached to a lesson.

* [ ] **Final Deployment:**
* Set up Environment variables (`APP_KEY`, `DB_`, `STRIPE_`).
* Run migrations and build production assets (`npm run build`).

### 4. Learning Interface Improvements
- [ ] **Quiz Support**: `lessons` table has `type=quiz`, but current view only supports Video/Text.
- [ ] **Resources/Attachments**: Support for downloading file attachments (`type=file`).
- [ ] **Prev/Next Navigation**: "Next Lesson" button at the bottom of the lesson content to auto-advance.

## 🛠 Tech Debt / Refactoring
- [ ] **Optimized Queries**: Ensure `LessonController` queries scale well with large courses (currently loading comments and progress in separate queries).
- [ ] **Mobile Responsiveness**: Verify the learning sidebar works smoothly on mobile (Toggle added, verify UX).
