To keep you organized, I’ve broken this down into a granular checklist. Since you're using **Laravel + Inertia + Shadcn**, this list prioritizes the "monolith" flow where the backend and frontend are tightly coupled.

### Phase 1: Foundation & Backend Core

**Goal:** Build the "Skeleton" that holds the data.

* [x] **Project Init:** Install Laravel, Breeze (React/Inertia), and initialize Shadcn UI.
* [ ] **Database Migrations:**
* `courses`: title, slug, description, price, status (draft/published).
* `modules`: course_id, title, weight (for ordering).
* `lessons`: module_id, title, content, type (video/text/quiz), weight.
* `enrollments`: user_id, course_id, enrolled_at.


* [ ] **Models & Relations:** Set up HasMany/BelongsTo relationships for the above.
* [ ] **Admin Course CRUD:**
* Create `CourseController` for basic resource actions.
* Build a "Create Course" form using Shadcn `Form` and `Input` components.


* [ ] **The "Builder" UI:**
* A single-page interface to add modules and lessons via Inertia modals.
* *Bonus:* Add drag-and-drop ordering for lessons using `@dnd-kit/core`.


* [ ] **Landing Page:** A public route fetching all "Published" courses and displaying them in a Shadcn `Card` grid.

### Phase 2: Payments & Gatekeeping

**Goal:** Turn it into a "Member-only" experience.

* [ ] **Payment Integration:**
* Install the SDK for your chosen gateway (e.g., Stripe or Chargily).
* Create a `CheckoutController` to handle the redirect to the payment provider.


* [ ] **Webhook Handler:**
* Create a route to receive payment success signals.
* Logic: Find the user, find the course, create an entry in the `enrollments` table.


* [ ] **Access Middleware:**
* Create `CheckEnrollment` middleware.
* Apply it to the `/courses/{slug}/lessons` routes to ensure the user has paid.


* [ ] **Student Dashboard:**
* A `/dashboard` route showing only the courses the authenticated user has purchased.


* [ ] **Progress Tracking:**
* Add a `completed_lessons` pivot table or a JSON column in `enrollments`.
* Create a "Mark as Complete" button in the lesson UI.



---

### Phase 3: Content Hosting & Player

**Goal:** High-quality delivery and final polish.

* [ ] **Video Storage Setup:**
* Configure Laravel `filesystems.php` for S3 or a similar provider.
* Create a secure link generator (Signed URLs) so videos aren't public.


* [ ] **The "Course Player" Layout:**
* Build a sidebar navigation that lists all modules/lessons.
* Build the main content area with a video player (use `video.js` or `react-player`).


* [ ] **Lesson Content Rendering:**
* If using Markdown, install `parsedown` (PHP) or `react-markdown`.
* Ensure Shadcn `Typography` styles are applied to the rendered content.


* [ ] **File Attachments:**
* Add functionality for students to download PDF/Resource files attached to a lesson.


* [ ] **Final Deployment:**
* Set up Environment variables (`APP_KEY`, `DB_`, `STRIPE_`).
* Run migrations and build production assets (`npm run build`).

### Suggested Daily Velocity

* **Days 1-5:** Phase 1 (You'll spend the most time here on the "Builder" UI).
* **Days 6-10:** Phase 2 (Focus on the Webhook reliability).
* **Days 11-15:** Phase 3 (Video player and UI polishing).

**Would you like me to write the code for the `CourseBuilder` database schema and the Eloquent relationships to get you started?**
